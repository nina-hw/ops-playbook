# Developer Webinar Ops Checklist

## Pre-Event
- Confirm speakers, run dry-run & tech check
- Registration page + email/social promo
- Timezone-friendly scheduling

## Live
- Start early for tech sanity check
- Moderate Q&A/chat; keep time
- Record session

## Post-Event
- Send replay + resources (segment: attendee vs no-show)
- Nurture follow-ups for next action
- Review: registrations, attendance, drop-off, follow-up conversions

### Note
Iâ€™ve coordinated developer-focused webinars end-to-end (speaker prep, live flow, nurture). Also ran programs for IT managers and decision-makers with tailored promotion and follow-ups.
