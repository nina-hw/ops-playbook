# Marketing Ops & Program Management Playbook

Hi ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Nina, a CRM & Marketing Ops Manager. I help growth and technical teams ship campaigns, events, and lifecycle programsâ€”with structure, clarity, and async-first collaboration.

This repo shares lightweight frameworks, playbooks, and checklists Iâ€™ve used to:
- Run smooth webinars and product campaigns
- Align regional comms across multiple teams
- Design lifecycle journeys around user behavior
- Document processes so async teams move fast without chaos

ðŸ§© Philosophy: Clear systems â†’ less noise â†’ better execution.
